        <p><b>Height-adjusted Weight Percentile</b></p>
        <p>
        &emsp;Precision in evaluating underweight and overweight status among children 
        and adolescents is paramount for averting health and developmental issues. 
        Existing standards for these assessments have faced scrutiny regarding their validity. 
        Applying IOFT criteria for underweight assessment reveals pronounced height
        dependence in males aged 11–13 and females aged 10–11. Notably, a discernible bias emerged,
        wherein children in the lower 25th percentile were classified as underweight five times more
        frequently than those in the upper 25th percentile. Similarly, the overweight assessment displayed
        robust height dependence in males aged 8–11 and females aged 7–10, with children in the lower
        25th percentile for height deemed obese four or five times more frequently than their counterparts
        in the upper 25th percentile. Furthermore, using the Japanese POW criteria for assessment
        revealed significant age dependence in addition to considerably underestimating the percentage
        of underweight and overweight cases under the age of seven. However, the height dependence
        for the POW criterion was smaller than the BMI criterion, and the difference between height
        classes was less than threefold.
        </p>
        <p>
        &emsp;To get a more robust assessment of thinness and overweight in children, the Height-adjusted
        weight percentile score was implemented here. In it, the childs height, weight and age are used
        to classify in which percentile it falls when compared to children of the same sex and height group.
        This can then be used for a more robust estimation of thinness and overweight. Some important notes
        are that this tool is only applicable for children between the ages of 5 and 17, and that the percentiles
        are calculated based on Japanese children data, meaning that it might not be applicable for non-japanese
        subjects.

        <p><b>Low Bone Mineral Density Risk Score</b></p>
        <p>&emsp;The prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) among female athletes is
            higher (up to ~40%) than that among their male counterparts. This makes it very important
            to properly assess low BMD risk in patients, as it increases the risk
            of stress fractures, among other problems. For that, a screening tool 
            was developed and validated for low BMD in female athletes. In it, athletes scoring ≥3
             are recommended to have BMD assessed by DXA.</p>
        <p>&emsp;To obtain the score, just fill the questionnaire in the corresponding page. Note that this
            scoring was developed for young female athletes, so that is the only demographic to which it
            applies (in particular, it was developed with Japanese female athletes data). This score is
            not meant to replace a medical assessment and diagnosis in no way shape or form, and was 
            developed as an assistive tool for experts to help monitor the athletes conditions.</p>
        <p>The list below gives examples of sports for each impact category:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>High-impact:</b> Rythmic gymnastics, athletics long jumping, hurdles, snowboard, ski jumping,
                figure skating, volleyball, ballet, mogul skiing, throwing, etc.
            </li>
            <li><b>Multidirectional-impact:</b> Football, rugby, athletics short distance, tennis, speed skating, 
                judo, basketball, pole vaulting, boxing, karate, ski cross-country, fencing, handball, wrestling, 
                ice hockey, etc.
            </li>
            <li><b>Low-impact:</b> Athletics medium and long distance, shooting, thriatlon, climbing, archery, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Non-impact:</b> Artistic swimming, sailing, water polo, cycling, high-diving, curling, swimming, canoe, etc.</li>
